/**
 * Original ART-DECOR template id: 2.16.756.5.30.1.1.10.3.45
 * Template description: This section MAY be used to provide the original representation of the current CDA document as it has been seen by the legal authenticator while signing.Notes:
 * - This template doesn't require PDF/A but keep in mind that only PDF/A contains all necessary information that allows to identically display the PDF on different machines.
 * - To ensure that digital data remains legible in the long term, PDF/A (but not PDF) is mentioned in the allowed list of archival formats for the Swiss Federal Archives.
 * - The certification requirements according to the Swiss EPR (EPRA) require PDF/A-1 oder PDF/A-2.
 * - Following the recommendations of CDA-CH V2 (2017), embedding the original representation in PDF/A-1a format is therefore strongly recommended.
 *
 * Element description: Contains the original representation of the current CDA document as it has been seen by the legal authenticator while signing.
