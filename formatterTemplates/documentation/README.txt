To create the multi-language Javadoc documentation for the eHC the JAutodoc plugin for Eclipse is used.

This plugin automates the Javadoc generation as far as possible with the template in this folder. 

For more information about JAutodoc and to download the plugin, please visit: 
http://jautodoc.sourceforge.net/ 

Feel free to improve the given template and thereby the eHC development !
